          <p>Then it's time for a test phase, integration- and acceptance. Probably load, stress, scaling, security etc. etc.
          <p>And finally it's time to hand everything over to operations or the line.
          <p>And theeeeen you can get some value from what ever you've been creating.
          <p>The ability to produce value early and continuously is gone, and when the project is done chances are that you have failed miserably on creating value.

<p>OK, some have improved.
<p>Many arganizations use Agile methodologies when they run their projects.
<p>They have more slack in their scope and it is possible to change direction as you go.
<p>Very well, but it's not enough.

      <h2>Agile is not enough!</h2>
      <aside class="notes">
<p>The problem doesn't sit in Agile as such, but outside.
<p>With Agile you can produce working software (in theory) fast and continuously.
<p>But everything outside of your project has to be able to receive what is produced at the same pace.
<p>The line must be able to absorb what is produced. E. g. Operations.
<p>How the software works in production after it's been handed over is unfortunately seldomn the Agile teams' responsibility.

<p>Kent Becks' definition of DevOps is great. Developers carry beepers.
<p>It's those who have created the crap that should be on call and get phoned up in the middle of the night if something happens.
<p>You can't distinguish between development and operations.
<p>The responisbility has to be on the same team.
<p>Then you have the incentives to create high quality software.

          <p>This is true for projects. You can't simply increase the budget and hire more people.
          <p>With continuous product development in _the line_ "to late" is never a thing. There you can adjust staffing continuously based on prioritization and business needs.

        <p>Autonomous teams are teams who can solve all tasks which is necessary to develop a product without interference from outside or the need to contact people external to the team.
        <p>The different teams have responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their product.
        <p>They are independent from each other so they can be pushed to production faster.
