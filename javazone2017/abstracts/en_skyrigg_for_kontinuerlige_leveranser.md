# A cloud rig for continuous delivery

The last year we have been working on migrating applications from internal hosting to the cloud at Norwegian Railways (NSB). We have also created a handful of new services and split up many of the legacy ones. Our main focus has been to enable fast flow of features into production while preserving world-class availability, stability, etc., and last but not least security.

An important criterion for us was that we should default to hosted services where possible instead of rolling our own infrastructure.
